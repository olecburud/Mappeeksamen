	abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

	abstract = {Attempting to achieve the high diversity of training goals in modern competitive alpine skiing simultaneously can be difficult and may lead to compromised overall adaptation. Therefore, we investigated the effect of block training periodization on maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15 male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N = 13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15 high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days. Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95\% of maximal heart rate separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative VO2max by 6.0\% (P {\textless} 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative peak power output by 5.5\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and power output at ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P {\textless} 0.01). No changes occurred for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in males of IT only (4.9\%, P {\textless} 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8\%, SJ -4.1\%; P {\textless} 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance. Compromised explosive jump performance might be associated with persisting muscle fatigue.},

	shorttitle = {Block periodization versus traditional training theory},
	abstract = {The basis of contemporary training theory were founded a few decades ago when knowledge was far from complete and workload levels, athletic results and demands were much lower than now. Traditional training periodization, i.e. the division of the seasonal program into smaller periods and training cycles, was proposed at that time and became a universal and monopolistic approach to training planning and analysis. Further sport progress emphasized the limitations and drawbacks of traditional periodization with regard to the preparation of contemporary top-level athletes and their demands. Major contradictions between traditional theory and practice needs appeared as 1) an inability to provide multi peak performances during the season; 2) the drawbacks of long lasting mixed training programs; 3) negative interactions of non-compatible workloads that induced conflicting training responses; and 4) insufficient training stimuli to help highly qualified athletes to progress, as a result of mixed training. The trials and successful experiences of prominent coaches and researchers led to alternative training concepts and, ultimately, to a reformed training approach that was called block periodization (BP). Its general idea suggests the use and sequencing of specialized mesocycle-blocks, where highly concentrated training workloads are focused on a minimal number of motor and technical abilities. Unlike traditional periodization, which usually tries to develop many abilities simultaneously, the block concept suggests consecutive training stimulation of carefully selected fitness components. The rational sequencing of specialized mesocycle-blocks presupposes the exploitation and superimposition of residual training effects, an idea that has recently been conceptualized and studied. It is hypothesized that different types of mesocycle-blocks are suitable to various modes of biological adaptation, i.e. homeostatic regulation or a mechanism of general adaptation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In short-term studies, block periodization of high-intensity training (HIT) has been shown to be an effective strategy that enhances performance and related physiological factors. However, long-term studies and detailed investigations of macro, meso, and micro-periodization of HIT blocks in world-class endurance athletes are currently lacking. In a recent study, we showed that the world’s most successful cross-country (XC) skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. One including extensive use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and one using a traditional method namely TRAD. In this study, we compare BP with TRAD in two comparable successful seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of HIT blocks in BP. The participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8 Olympic gold medals, 18 world championship titles, and 114 world cup victories. Training data was categorized by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low (LIT), moderate (MIT), and HIT], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing). No significant difference was found in the total endurance training load between BP and TRAD. However, training volume in BP was lower compared to TRAD (15 ± 6 vs. 18 ± 7 h/wk, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.001), mainly explained by less LIT (13 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 h/wk, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.004). Lower volume of MIT was also performed in BP compared to TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions/year), whereas the amount of HIT was higher in BP (157 vs. 77 sessions/year). While BP included high amounts of HIT already from the first preparation period, followed by a reduction toward the competition period, TRAD had a progressive increase in HIT toward the competition period. In BP, the athlete performed seven HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, each including 8–13 HIT sessions. This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different periodization models in the worlds best XC skier, and illustrates the macro, meso and micro- periodization of HIT blocks to increase the overall amount of HIT.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Furthermore, increased levels of apoptosis have also been reported in old rats undergoing acute muscle atrophy subsequent to muscle unloading, a condition that mimics the muscle loss observed during prolonged bed rest. Notably, preliminary evidence seems to confirm a causative role for apoptosis in age-related muscle loss in human subjects. Several signaling pathways of skeletal muscle apoptosis are currently under intense investigation, with a particular focus on the role played by mitochondria. Here, we will review the most recent evidence regarding various pathways of muscle apoptosis and their modulation by several interventions (caloric restriction, physical exercise, muscle unloading).},

Running economy is improved by performing combined endurance training with either heavy or explosive strength training. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. Concurrent endurance and heavy strength training can increase running speed and power output at VO2max (Vmax and Wmax, respectively) or time to exhaustion at Vmax and Wmax. Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. It is suggested that the improved endurance performance may relate to delayed activation of less efficient type II fibers, improved neuromuscular efficiency, conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibers into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, or improved musculo-tendinous stiffness.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of training to muscle failure or non-failure on muscular strength and hypertrophy.
METHODS: Meta-analyses of effect sizes (ESs) explored the effects of training to failure vs. non-failure on strength and hypertrophy. Subgroup meta-analyses explored potential moderating effects of variables such as training status (trained vs. untrained), training volume (volume equated vs. volume non-equated), body region (upper vs. lower), exercise selection (multi- vs. single-joint exercises (only for strength)), and study design (independent vs. dependent groups).
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review. All studies included young adults as participants. Meta-analysis indicated no significant difference between the training conditions for muscular strength (ES = -0.09, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): -0.22 to 0.05) and for hypertrophy (ES = 0.22, 95\%CI: -0.11 to 0.55). Subgroup analyses that stratified the studies according to body region, exercise selection, or study design showed no significant differences between training conditions. In studies that did not equate training volume between the groups, the analysis showed significant favoring of non-failure training on strength gains (ES = -0.32, 95\%CI: -0.57 to -0.07). In the subgroup analysis for resistance-trained individuals, the analysis showed a significant effect of training to failure for muscle hypertrophy (ES = 0.15, 95\%CI: 0.03-0.26).
CONCLUSION: Training to muscle failure does not seem to be required for gains in strength and muscle size. However, training in this manner does not seem to have detrimental effects on these adaptations, either. More studies should be conducted among older adults and highly trained individuals to improve the generalizability of these findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morganella morganii is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacillus divided into two subspecies, morganii and sibonii. Previously classified as Proteus morganii, it belongs to human gut commensal microbiota. Nevertheless, on rare occasions, especially in nosocomial and postoperative environment as well as in patients with the impaired immune system and young children, it may cause potentially fatal systemic infection.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of our systematic review was to determine whether and what invasive infections in humans were caused by Morganella morganii and to estimate outcomes of administered antibiotic management.
DATA SOURCES: This systematic review was registered at the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses before initiation of the research (registration number CRD42020171919). Study eligibility criteria and participants. patients of any age and both sex harbouring Morganella morganii as the only microorganism in bodily fluids or tissues, from where it was isolated and identified by one or more of the following diagnostic methods: conventional techniques including colony morphology, Vitek 2, API or BD Phoenix biochemical systems, as well as more sophisticated methods, such as Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and species-specific PCR for M. morganii.
METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS: We have systematically searched MEDLINE, EBSCO, SCOPUS, SCINDEX and GOOGLE SCHOLAR for case reports and case series with M. morganii invasive infections.
RESULTS: M. morganii can cause serious infections of different tissue in patients of any age. The most isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, imipenem and amikacin. Majority of the patients completely recovered after antibiotic treatment. About 15\% of the patients died despite of the therapy. Gentamicin was the most frequently used antibiotic in the treatment of infection caused by M. morganii.
CONCLUSION: M. morganii invasive infections should be taken into consideration by the clinicians, especially in hospital conditions, due to its high degree of mortality and high potential of this bacterium to develop multidrug resistance. Treatment of M. morganii infections should include gentamycin in combination with third generation cephalosporin or another antibiotic to which M. morganii is susceptible (after testing isolates for third cephalosporin generation for the production of AmpC β -lactamases).},

	abstract = {We have reported that the acute postexercise increases in muscle protein synthesis rates, with differing nutritional support, are predictive of longer-term training-induced muscle hypertrophy. Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen men (21 ± 1 yr, 22.6 ± 2.1 kg/m2; means ± SE) had their legs randomly assigned to two of three training conditions that differed in contraction intensity [\% of maximal strength (1 repetition maximum)] or contraction volume (1 or 3 sets of repetitions): 30\%-3, 80\%-1, and 80\%-3. Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant (P {\textless} 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30\%-3 = 6.8 ± 1.8\%, 80\%-1 = 3.2 ± 0.8\%, and 80\%-3= 7.2 ± 1.9\%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80\%-1 and 80\%-3, but were greater than 30\%-3 (P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions (P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation (P {\textless} 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80\%-1 and 80\%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy. In accordance with our previous acute measurements of muscle protein synthetic rates a lower load lifted to failure resulted in similar hypertrophy as a heavy load lifted to failure.},

	abstract = {In the exercising human, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles. This is shown by three major lines of evidence: 1) when oxygen delivery is altered (by blood doping, hypoxia, or beta-blockade), VO2max changes accordingly; 2) the increase in VO2max with training results primarily from an increase in maximal cardiac output (not an increase in the a-v O2 difference); and 3) when a small muscle mass is overperfused during exercise, it has an extremely high capacity for consuming oxygen. Thus, O2 delivery, not skeletal muscle O2 extraction, is viewed as the primary limiting factor for VO2max in exercising humans. Metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle are, however, critical for improving submaximal endurance performance. Endurance training causes an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities, which improves performance by enhancing fat oxidation and decreasing lactic acid accumulation at a given VO2. VO2max is an important variable that sets the upper limit for endurance performance (an athlete cannot operate above 100\% VO2max, for extended periods). Running economy and fractional utilization of VO2max also affect endurance performance. The speed at lactate threshold (LT) integrates all three of these variables and is the best physiological predictor of distance running performance.},

	abstract = {Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors--maximal oxygen consumption (.VO(2,max)), the so-called 'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a given running speed or cycling power output)--appear to play key roles in endurance performance. and lactate threshold interact to determine the 'performance .VO(2)' which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance .VO(2) to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with .VO(2,max) and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future.},

The aim of this article is to provide a brief theoretical and practical tutorial for neurosurgeons wishing to conduct or interpret regression analyses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data preparation, univariable and multivariable analysis, choice of model, model requirements and assumptions are discussed, as essential prerequisites to any regression analysis. Four main types of regression techniques are presented: linear, logistic, multinomial logistic, and proportional odds logistic. To illustrate the applications of regression to real-world data and exemplify the concepts introduced, we used a previously reported data set of patients with intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clip reconstruction at the Department of Neurosurgery of Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, between January 2000 and January 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis is a powerful and versatile instrument in data analysis. This material is intended as a starter for those wishing to critically interpret or perform regression analysis and we recommend multidisciplinary collaborations with trained methodologists, statisticians, or epidemiologists.},

Searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were conducted for studies that met the following criteria: (a) an experimental trial involving both low-load training [≤60\% 1 repetition maximum (1RM)] and high-load training ({\textgreater}60\% 1RM); (b) with all sets in the training protocols being performed to momentary muscular failure; (c) at least one method of estimating changes in muscle mass or dynamic, isometric, or isokinetic strength was used; (d) the training protocol lasted for a minimum of 6 weeks; (e) the study involved participants with no known medical conditions or injuries impairing training capacity. A total of 21 studies were ultimately included for analysis. Gains in 1RM strength were significantly greater in favor of high- vs. low-load training, whereas no significant differences were found for isometric strength between conditions. Changes in measures of muscle hypertrophy were similar between conditions. The findings indicate that maximal strength benefits are obtained from the use of heavy loads while muscle hypertrophy can be equally achieved across a spectrum of loading ranges.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increases in muscular strength may increase sports performance, reduce injury risk, are associated with a plethora of health markers, as well as exerting positive psychological effects. Due to their efficiency and effectiveness in increasing total body muscular strength, multi-joint exercises like the powerlifts, i.e.: the squat (SQ), bench-press (BP) and deadlift (DL), are widely used by active individuals as well as athletes in the pursuit of increasing strength. To date, the concept of a minimum dose, i.e. "what is the minimum one needs to do to increase 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength?" has not been directly examined in the literature, especially in the context of the powerlifts. This review aims to explore the current available evidence around the minimum effective training dose required to increase 1RM strength in trained individuals in an attempt to enhance the practical guidelines around resistance-training as well as provide active individuals, athletes and coaches with more flexibility when designing a training protocol.
METHODS: One reviewer independently conducted the search in a PRISMA systematic approach using PubMed, SportDiscus and Google Scholar databases. The databases were searched with the following search terms/phrases and Boolean operators: "training volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength" OR "powerlifters", "low volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength", "high vs low volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength", "minimum effective training dose 1RM". Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the change in 1RM strength for the lowest dose group in the included studies.
RESULTS: From the initial 2629 studies, 6 studies met our inclusion criteria. All identified studies showed that a single set performed minimum 1 time and maximum 3 times per week was sufficient to induce significant 1RM strength gains. Meta-analysis of 5 studies showed an estimated increase for overall 1RM of 12.09 kg [95\% CIs 8.16 kg-16.03 kg], an increase of 17.48 kg [95\% CIs 8.51 kg-26.46 kg] for the SQ, and 8.25 kg [95\% CIs 0.68 kg-15.83 kg] for the BP. All of the included studies contained details on most of the variables comprising "training dose", such as: weekly and per session sets and repetitions as well as intensity of effort. Specific information regarding load (\%1RM) was not provided by all studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present systematic review suggest that performing a single set of 6-12 repetitions with loads ranging from approximately 70-85\% 1RM 2-3 times per week with high intensity of effort (reaching volitional or momentary failure) for 8-12 weeks can produce suboptimal, yet significant increases in SQ and BP 1RM strength in resistance-trained men. However, because of the lack of research, it is less clear as to whether these improvements may also be achievable in DL 1RM strength or in trained women and highly trained strength athletes.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of single- and multiple-set strength training on hypertrophy and strength gains in untrained men. Twenty-one young men were randomly assigned to either the 3L-1UB group (trained 3 sets in leg exercises and 1 set in upper-body exercises; n = 11), or the 1L-3UB (trained 1 set in leg exercises and 3 sets in upper-body exercises; n = 10). Subjects trained 3 days per week for 11 weeks and each workout consisted of 3 leg exercises and 5 upper-body exercises. Training intensity varied between 10 repetition maximum (RM) and 7RM. Strength (1RM) was tested in all leg and upper-body exercises and in 2 isokinetic tests before training, and after 3, 6, 9, and 11 weeks of training. Cross sectional area (CSA) of thigh muscles and the trapezius muscle and body composition measures were performed before training, and after 5 and 11 weeks of training. The increase in 1RM from week 0 to 11 in the lower-body exercises was significantly higher in the 3L-1UB group than in the 1L-3UB group (41 vs. 21\%; p {\textless} 0.001), while no difference existed between groups in upper-body exercises. Peak torque in maximal isokinetic knee-extension and thigh CSA increased more in the 3L-1UB group than in the 1L-3UB group (16 vs. 8\%; p = 0.03 and 11 vs. 7\%; p = 0.01, respectively), while there was no significant difference between groups in upper trapezius muscle CSA. The results demonstrate that 3-set strength training is superior to 1-set strength training with regard to strength and muscle mass gains in the leg muscles, while no difference exists between 1- and 3-set training in upper-body muscles in untrained men.},

Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2−ΔΔCT method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2−ΔΔCT method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2−ΔΔCT method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.},

	abstract = {Determination of muscle fiber composition in human skeletal muscle biopsies is often performed using immunohistochemistry, a method that tends to be both time consuming, technically challenging, and complicated by limited availability of tissue. Here, we introduce quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based Gene-family profiling (GeneFam) of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNA expression as a high-throughput, sensitive, and reliable alternative. We show that GeneFam and immunohistochemistry result in similar disclosures of alterations in muscle fiber composition in biopsies from musculus vastus lateralis and musculus biceps brachii of previously untrained young women after 12 weeks of progressive strength training. The adaptations were evident as (a) consistent increases in MyHC2A abundance; (b) consistent decreases in MyHC2X abundance; and (c) consistently stable MyHC1 abundance, and were not found using traditional reference gene-based qRT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, muscle fiber composition found using each of the two approaches was correlated with each other (r = 0.50, 0.74, and 0.78 for MyHC1, A, and X, respectively), suggesting that GeneFam may be suitable for ranking of individual muscle phenotype, particularly for MyHC2 fibers. In summary, GeneFam of MyHC mRNA resulted in reliable assessment of alterations in muscle fiber composition in skeletal muscle of previously untrained women after 12 weeks of strength training.},

Following the period of resistance training, MHC IIX content decreased from 9.3 +/- 2.1\% to 2.0 +/- 0.8\% (P {\textless} 0.01), with a corresponding increase in MHC IIA (42.4 +/- 3.9\% vs. 49.6 +/- 4.0\% [P {\textless} 0.05]). Following detraining the amount of MHC IIX reached values that were higher than before and after resistance training (17.2 +/- 3.2\% [P {\textless} 0.01]). Changes in fiber type composition resembled the changes observed in MHC isoform content. Significant hypertrophy was observed for the type II fibers after resistance training. Maximal isometric quadriceps strength increased after resistance training, but returned to pretraining levels after detraining. The present results suggest that heavy-load resistance training decreases the amount of MHC IIX while reciprocally increasing MHC IIA content. Furthermore, detraining following heavy-load resistance training seems to evoke an overshoot in the amount of MHC IIX to values markedly higher than those observed prior to resistance training.},
