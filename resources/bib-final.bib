	abstract = {We examined hypertrophic outcomes of weekly graded whey protein dosing (GWP) vs. whey protein (WP) or maltodextrin (MALTO) dosed once daily during 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5 +/- 3 years; mean +/- SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2 lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from 10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3 (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p {\textless} 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p {\textless} 0.05). However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p {\textless} 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area ({\textasciitilde}+300 mum(2)). When examining the effects of training on LBM increases (DeltaLBM) in all participants combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting DeltaLBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) but not MID to POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program, ECW-corrected DeltaLBM gains were largely dampened, but still positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded {\textasciitilde}20 sets/exercise/wk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},

	doi = {10.1525/collabra.33267},
	abstract = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

	abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources.},

  title     = "Limiting factors for maximum oxygen uptake and determinants of
               endurance performance",
  author    = "Bassett, Jr, D R and Howley, E T",
  abstract  = "In the exercising human, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is
               limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to
               deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles. This is shown by three
               major lines of evidence: 1) when oxygen delivery is altered (by
               blood doping, hypoxia, or beta-blockade), VO2max changes
               accordingly; 2) the increase in VO2max with training results
               primarily from an increase in maximal cardiac output (not an
               increase in the a-v O2 difference); and 3) when a small muscle
               mass is overperfused during exercise, it has an extremely high
               capacity for consuming oxygen. Thus, O2 delivery, not skeletal
               muscle O2 extraction, is viewed as the primary limiting factor
               for VO2max in exercising humans. Metabolic adaptations in
               skeletal muscle are, however, critical for improving submaximal
               endurance performance. Endurance training causes an increase in
               mitochondrial enzyme activities, which improves performance by
               enhancing fat oxidation and decreasing lactic acid accumulation
               at a given VO2. VO2max is an important variable that sets the
               upper limit for endurance performance (an athlete cannot operate
               above 100\% VO2max, for extended periods). Running economy and
               fractional utilization of VO2max also affect endurance
               performance. The speed at lactate threshold (LT) integrates all
               three of these variables and is the best physiological predictor
               of distance running performance.",

               and sports-science research and routine testing, internal
               validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as

  abstract  = "Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of
               champion athletes and record performances have been ongoing for
               about a century. For endurance sports three main
               factors--maximal oxygen consumption (.VO(2,max)), the so-called
               'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to
               generate a given running speed or cycling power output)--appear
               to play key roles in endurance performance. and lactate
               threshold interact to determine the 'performance .VO(2)' which
               is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given
               period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance .VO(2)
               to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this
               oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently
               known about how these factors interact, their utility as
               predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is
               relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this
               context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants
               of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in
               comparison with .VO(2,max) and the lactate threshold, and there
               is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic
               factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should
               also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological
               factors also play important roles in who does or does not become
               a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological
               explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is
               likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by
               scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those
               interested in physiological integration well into the future.",

              performance diagnostics in endurance athletes",
  author   = "Bentley, David J and Newell, John and Bishop, David",
  abstract = "Physiological variables, such as maximum work rate or maximal
              oxygen uptake (VO2max), together with other submaximal metabolic
              inflection points (e.g. the lactate threshold [LT], the onset of
              blood lactate accumulation and the pulmonary ventilation
              threshold [VT]), are regularly quantified by sports scientists
              during an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. These
              variables have been shown to correlate with endurance
              performance, have been used to prescribe exercise training loads
              and are useful to monitor adaptation to training. However, an
              incremental exercise test can be modified in terms of starting
              and subsequent work rates, increments and duration of each stage.
              At the same time, the analysis of the blood lactate/ventilatory
              response to incremental exercise may vary due to the medium of
              blood analysed and the treatment (or mathematical modelling) of
              data following the test to model the metabolic inflection points.
              Modification of the stage duration during an incremental exercise
              test may influence the submaximal and maximal physiological
              variables. In particular, the peak power output is reduced in
              incremental exercise tests that have stages of longer duration.
              Furthermore, the VT or LT may also occur at higher absolute
              exercise work rate in incremental tests comprising shorter
              stages. These effects may influence the relationship of the
              variables to endurance performance or potentially influence the
              sensitivity of these results to endurance training. A difference
              in maximum work rate with modification of incremental exercise
              test design may change the validity of using these results for
              predicting performance, and prescribing or monitoring training.
              Sports scientists and coaches should consider these factors when
              conducting incremental exercise testing for the purposes of
              performance diagnostics.",

               framework for the evaluation of endurance capacity as well as
               for the derivation of exercise prescription by the use of two
               gas exchange thresholds: aerobic (AerTGE) and anaerobic (AnTGE).
               AerT GE corresponds to the first increase in blood lactate
               during incremental exercise whereas AnTGE approximates the
               maximal lactate steady state. With very few constraints, they
               are valid in competitive athletes, sedentary subjects, and
               patients. In the second part of the paper, the practical
               application of gas exchange thresholds in cross-sectional and
               longitudinal studies is described, thereby further validating
               the 2-threshold model. It is shown that AerTGE and AnTGE can
               reliably distinguish between different states of endurance
               capacity and that they can well detect training-induced changes.
               Factors influencing their relationship to the maximal oxygen
               uptake are discussed. Finally, some approaches of using gas
               exchange thresholds for exercise prescription in athletes,
